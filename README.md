# JokeBookAndroid
Simple App that serves jokes from https://official-joke-api.appspot.com

## Local Deployment

The only way I know of deploying this locally is using Android Studio device emulation (https://developer.android.com/studio).
Clone the project and use the device emulation feature to see the app.
